# Things to cover in future lectures

## React components

- Define components as a function of props (React ^0.14, see [Cam Jackson's blog post](https://camjackson.net/post/9-things-every-reactjs-beginner-should-know)).
- PropTypes (validation)
- _Actually_ keep all business logic out of the components. _ONLY_ render logic!
- Make tests fail on propType errors (see ^ blog post).
- React Dev Tools!
